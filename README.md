## Introduction
The MONTRE-DE1 project aims to create a versatile and powerful watch using a System-on-Chip approach. By leveraging the capabilities of Quartus II and NIOS II, we can develop a watch that goes beyond basic timekeeping.

## Features
- **Timekeeping**: The MONTRE-DE1 watch accurately displays the current time with various options for customization.
- **Alarms**: Set multiple alarms to be reminded of important events or tasks.
- **Stopwatch**: Measure elapsed time with a built-in stopwatch feature.
- **Countdown Timer**: Set timers to count down from a specific duration.
- **User Interaction**: The watch features buttons and a graphical display for user input and visual feedback.
- **Battery Management**: Efficient power management to maximize battery life.

## Getting Started
To get started with the MONTRE-DE1 project, follow the instructions below.

### Prerequisites
- Quartus II: Install the latest version of Quartus II from the official Intel FPGA website.
- NIOS II: Set up the NIOS II development environment by referring to the documentation provided by Intel FPGA.

### Installation
1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/hamzafijahi2001/montre-de1.git`
2. Open Quartus II and create a new project.
3. Import the project files from the cloned repository into your Quartus II project.
4. Set up the NIOS II processor in your project configuration.
5. Build the project and generate the programming file for the FPGA.
6. Program the FPGA with the generated file.

## Usage
Once the MONTRE-DE1 project is successfully built and programmed onto the FPGA, you can interact with the watch using the buttons and graphical display. Follow the on-screen instructions to navigate through the various features and customize your watch.
